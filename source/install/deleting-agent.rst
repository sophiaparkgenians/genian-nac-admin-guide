Deleting Agent
==============

You can uninstall the Agent on the endpoints by using a Group Policy which allows you to group many devices together and uninstall the Agent as each device comes onto the network. This is useful if you have a large number of devices that will no longer be seen on the network. (*e.g. A School with Seniors graduating will have no need for the Agent to remain on their devices.*)
