Creating Enforcement Policy for Node Group
==========================================

**Enforcement Policies** work in a similar fashion to sorting in a mail room. All Nodes flow through a Priority List of **Enforcement Policies** to decide how much access they are allowed and which Groups they fit into. (*When creating custom Enforcement Policies, or re-arranging your Enforcement Policy list, two Enforcement Policies are required to stay where they are*)

- **Blocking Exceptions**: A custom Enforcement Policy cannot be placed above the Blocking Exceptions, or the Exceptions will not be properly applied
- **Default Policy**: A custom Enforcement Policy cannot be placed below the Default Policy,  as these are the bottom baselines for Enforcement
